            The Android Market, erm Play Store, has finally become crowded enough for developers to pay attention to their application's design in an attempt to woo users away from their competitors, and honestly I couldn't be happier. Just a few short years ago no one even gave Android design a second though, and we still see Gingerbread's orange glow shining through today. Last week I attended an Android Design Meetup and the enthusiasm in the room was palatable.

            <p>Recently, while debugging a personal project, I noticed that Facebook&#8217;s Android app would run the DEX loader whenever I deployed my application to my phone. This was a surprise to me because although I have the Facebook application installed, I don&#8217;t use Facebook Home and wouldn&#8217;t expect the app to be monitoring package installations and replacements. While technically I did give their app permission to do this, I was still astonished to see their app doing so much work for no user benefit. Given Facebook&#8217;s lackluster history with Android, I decided to dig deeper and uncover more ways their application was abusing my phone&#8217;s battery life. Despite disabling notification polling in the app&#8217;s settings, Facebook seemed to always be running on my phone (using a precious 40MB-80MB of RAM) so I had little reason to believe they were being battery conscious.</p>

            <p>So I&#8217;ve decided to start writing in hope that my ramblings may serve some utility to someone, and this is the meta post that describes how this blog come into existence. Deciding to actually write something that the world could read is a pretty significant step for a introvert like myself, but its only the beginning of the rather tedious process that is &#8216;setting up a blog.&#8217; Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are a <strong>ton</strong> of options out there, and well, that&#8217;s kinda the problem. Just off the top of my head:</p>
